# System Architecture Overview

## Introduction
The architecture of the Global Climate Control System (GCCS-Core) is designed to facilitate real-time climate monitoring, predictive analytics, and geoengineering interventions. This document provides an overview of the system's components and their interactions.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Data Ingestion Layer
- **IoT Sensors**: Collect real-time climate data (temperature, humidity, CO2 levels, etc.).
- **Data Pipeline**: Processes incoming data streams and stores them in a centralized database.

### 2. Core Processing Layer
- **Climate Monitoring Module**: Analyzes real-time data to identify trends and anomalies.
- **Predictive Modeling Module**: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to forecast climate patterns and extreme weather events.
- **Geoengineering Module**: Implements strategies for climate intervention based on analysis results.

### 3. API Layer
- **RESTful API**: Provides endpoints for accessing climate data and intervention strategies. Enables integration with external applications and services.

### 4. User Interface
- **Web Dashboard**: A user-friendly interface for stakeholders to visualize climate data, monitor interventions, and generate reports.

## Data Flow
1. **Data Collection**: IoT sensors collect data and send it to the Data Ingestion Layer.
2. **Data Processing**: The Core Processing Layer analyzes the data and generates insights.
3. **API Access**: Stakeholders access the processed data and insights through the API.
4. **User  Interaction**: Users interact with the system via the Web Dashboard to make informed decisions.

## Conclusion
The GCCS-Core architecture is modular and scalable, allowing for easy integration of new features and technologies as they become available.
