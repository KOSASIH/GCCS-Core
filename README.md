# GCCS-Core
The GCCS-Core repository serves as the foundational framework for the Global Climate Control System (GCCS). It encompasses the core algorithms, data models, and APIs necessary for real-time climate monitoring, predictive analytics, and geoengineering interventions. This repository facilitates the integration of IoT sensor data, machine learning models, and decision support tools, enabling stakeholders to collaboratively address climate change challenges and implement targeted mitigation strategies.
