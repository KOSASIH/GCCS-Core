# GCCS-Core
The GCCS-Core repository serves as the foundational framework for the Global Climate Control System (GCCS). It encompasses the core algorithms, data models, and APIs necessary for real-time climate monitoring, predictive analytics, and geoengineering interventions. This repository facilitates the integration of IoT sensor data, machine learning models, and decision support tools, enabling stakeholders to collaboratively address climate change challenges and implement targeted mitigation strategies.

# Global Climate Control System (GCCS-Core)

## Overview
The Global Climate Control System (GCCS-Core) is an advanced framework designed to monitor and manage global climate conditions using cutting-edge technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), and geoengineering techniques. The system aims to mitigate the effects of climate change through real-time data analysis, predictive modeling, and targeted interventions.

## Features
- Real-time climate monitoring using IoT sensors
- Predictive modeling for climate patterns and extreme weather events
- Implementation of geoengineering techniques, including carbon capture and solar radiation management
- API for accessing climate data and intervention strategies
- Comprehensive documentation and user guides

## Installation Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- Git

### Clone the Repository
```bash
1 git clone https://github.com/KOSASIH/GCCS-Core.git
2 cd GCCS-Core
```

### Install Dependencies
